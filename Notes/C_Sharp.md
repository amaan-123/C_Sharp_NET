# C# Notes

## C# Tutorial: Code With Harry 

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuLiu5AK9Ps>

This video provides a comprehensive introduction to the C# programming language and the .NET Framework. The goal is to become comfortable with the .NET Framework and learn C# programming.

### What is C# and .NET Framework?

- C# is a programming language used for creating games, console applications, and Windows desktop applications.
- C# runs on the .NET Framework.
- This means that **C# is a part of .NET**.
- **.NET Framework is an open-source developer platform**.
- Open source means that community contributions are possible, and the source code is available on GitHub for contribution.
- .NET Framework is also **cross-platform**, meaning it runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Originally, .NET was built to run on Windows, but over time, Microsoft made it compatible with Linux and macOS.
- With the .NET Framework, you can build **mobile apps, desktop applications, and games**.
- You can use multiple languages and compile them into a single project, then leverage the APIs and libraries exposed by the .NET Framework.
- It's recommended to learn one language, like C#, first to understand the framework.

### Setting up the Development Environment

- The first step is to set up the development environment.
- This involves installing **Visual Studio**.
- Visual Studio is recommended for running C# applications.
- There might be different versions of Visual Studio (e.g., 2019, 2021) depending on the current year, but the latest version available should be downloaded.
- **Don't confuse Visual Studio with Visual Studio Code**.
- Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor.
- An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** like Visual Studio provides a complete environment, including a compiler and other tools needed to compile a programming language into machine code.
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code is lightweight and provides a simple debugger but lacks many features of an IDE.
- Visual Studio is a powerful tool.
- When installing Visual Studio, it's recommended to download the **Community version**, which is free, rather than the Enterprise version which requires payment.

### Installing Visual Studio

- After downloading the installer, you need to configure and install.
- The installation process may take some time.
- You need to choose workloads.
- **.NET desktop environment** is the required workload for this tutorial.
- Click on ".NET desktop environment" and select "Install while downloading".
- The installation size can be around 5 GB, but the actual size might vary depending on pre-installed components like Windows updates.
- Don't worry too much about the size or complexities presented in the installer; just select the required components.
- An SSD can help with performance if your computer is slow, but that's a separate topic.

### C# Program Basics

- C# is a programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
- It's used for building **web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, and games**.
- Console applications are a basic type of application used for learning C#.
- The video will start with a "Hello World" program to build confidence.

### .NET Framework Architecture

- The architecture of the .NET Framework can be viewed on Microsoft's official documentation website.
- There are two major components in the .NET Framework: **CLR (Common Language Runtime)** and the **.NET Framework Class Library**.
- The **CLR is the execution engine** that handles .NET applications.
- A .NET application can be written using multiple programming languages (e.g., C#, Visual Basic, F#).
- The code written in these languages is compiled by their respective compilers into a **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**.
- CIL is not machine code; it's an intermediate language that is the same for code written in different .NET languages.
- The compiled code in CIL is stored in **.dll or .exe files**.
- Once the compiled code exists, the **CLR uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler** to compile the CIL code into machine code that can be executed on the specific architecture of the computer it's running on (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit).
- The CLR also provides services like **memory management**.
- **Garbage Collection** is a form of automatic memory management where the system reclaims memory that is no longer being used by the program. This is unlike languages like C or C++ where manual memory management is required.
- The **.NET Framework Class Library** is a set of APIs that provide common functionalities like reading files or connecting to databases.

### Creating the First C# Project

- After Visual Studio is installed and updated, you will see a start screen.
- Click on **"Create a new project"**.
- Filter by language (C#) and platform if needed.
- Select the **"Console App (.NET Framework)"** template. This creates a console application that runs on the .NET Framework.
- Give the project a name (e.g., "Hello") and click "Create".
- Visual Studio will create and import the necessary files for the project.
- Patience might be required if your computer has low RAM.

### Writing the First C# Program

- The main code area is where you will write your instructions.
- Program execution in C# starts from the `Main` function.
- To print output to the console, use `Console.WriteLine()`.
- Example: `Console.WriteLine("Hello World");`.
- To prevent the console window from closing immediately after execution, use `Console.ReadLine()`. This waits for the user to press Enter.
- Example: `Console.ReadLine();`.
- The complete basic program looks like this:

```csharp
using System;

namespace Hello
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

- To run the program, click the "Start" button in Visual Studio.

### Structure of a C# Program

- The structure includes:
  - **`using System;`**: This statement allows you to use classes from the `System` namespace, such as `Console`.
  - **`namespace Hello`**: A namespace acts as a container for classes and other namespaces, helping to organize code. It helps avoid naming conflicts.
  - **`class Program`**: A class is a container for data (data members) and methods (member functions) that give your program "life".
  - **`static void Main(string[] args)`**: This is the **entry point of the program execution**. The program starts running from here.
    - `static`: Means the method belongs to the `Program` class, not a specific instance of the class.
    - `void`: Means the method does not return any value.
    - `Main`: The name of the main method.
    - `string[] args`: Command-line arguments (not discussed in detail yet).
  - Curly braces `{}` define the start and end of blocks of code for namespaces, classes, and methods.
  - **Instructions end with a semicolon `;`**.

- `Console.WriteLine()` prints text to the console followed by a new line.
- `Console.Write()` prints text without adding a new line.

### Comments

- Comments are used to add notes to the code that are ignored by the compiler.
- They help explain the code to other developers (or yourself later).
- **Single-line comments** start with `//`. Everything after `//` on that line is a comment.
- Example:

```csharp
// This is a single-line comment
Console.WriteLine("Hello World"); // Print Hello World
```

- **Multi-line comments** start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Everything between these markers is a comment.
- Example:

```csharp
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
```

### Variables and Data Types

- **Variables are containers** that store values of a specific type.
- Analogy: A container in the kitchen stores things like salt or sugar; a bucket stores water. The container's name is the variable name, and the content is the value.
- When you declare a variable like `int age = 34;`, you are telling C# to create a container named `age` in memory and store the value 34 in it.
- **Data Types** define the type of value a variable can hold and how much memory it occupies.

- Common Data Types in C#:
  - `int`: Stores whole numbers (integers), both positive and negative. Takes **4 bytes** of memory.
  - `float`: Stores single-precision floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals). Takes **4 bytes** of memory. Requires an `f` or `F` suffix for literal values.
  - `char`: Stores a single character (e.g., 'A', 'b', '7'). Character literals are enclosed in single quotes. Takes **2 bytes** of memory.
  - `bool`: Stores boolean values: `true` or `false`. Used for conditions. Takes **1 byte** of memory.
  - `string`: Stores a sequence of characters (text). String literals are enclosed in double quotes. Takes **2 bytes per character**.
  - `long`: Stores large whole numbers. Takes **8 bytes** of memory. Can be positive or negative.
  - `double`: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers. Takes **8 bytes** of memory. Provides more precision than `float` (up to 15 decimal digits). Decimal numbers in C# are **by default `double`**. You can use a `d` or `D` suffix for clarity but it's not strictly required.

- Example variable declarations:

```csharp
int integerVariable = 10;
float floatVariable = 3.14f;
char characterVariable = 'A';
bool booleanVariable = true;
string stringVariable = "Hello";
long longVariable = 1234567890L; // Optional L suffix for clarity
double doubleVariable = 9.87654321; // Optional D suffix for clarity
```

### User Input

- To get input from the user in a console application, use `Console.ReadLine()`.
- `Console.ReadLine()` reads a line of text from the console and **returns it as a `string`**.
- Example:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Enter your name:");
string name = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name);
```

### Type Casting (Conversion)

- **Type casting** or **conversion** is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
- There are multiple ways to do this in C#:

1. **Implicit Casting (Automatic Conversion)**:
    - Occurs automatically when converting a smaller type to a larger type where no data loss is possible.
    - Example: converting an `int` to a `double`. An `int` can fit inside a `double`.
    - The automatic promotion hierarchy is generally: `char` -> `int` -> `long` -> `float` -> `double`.
    - Example:

    ```csharp
    int myInt = 3;
    double myDouble = myInt; // Implicit casting from int to double
    Console.WriteLine(myDouble); // Output: 3
    ```

    - If you try to implicitly cast a larger type to a smaller type (e.g., `double` to `int`), it will result in a compile-time error because data loss is possible.

2. **Explicit Casting (Manual Conversion)**:
    - Done manually using parentheses `(type)` before the value to convert.
    - Required when converting a larger type to a smaller type where data loss might occur.
    - Example: converting a `double` to an `int`. The decimal part will be truncated.
    - Example:

    ```csharp
    double myDouble = 3.14;
    int myInt = (int)myDouble; // Explicit casting from double to int
    Console.WriteLine(myInt); // Output: 3
    ```

    - **Note:** Casting a `char` to an `int` explicitly or implicitly results in the integer value of the character's ASCII code.

3. **Conversion using Built-in Methods**:
    - The `Convert` class provides various methods to convert between types.
    - This is useful when converting between types that cannot be implicitly or explicitly cast directly, such as converting a `string` to a number.
    - Example methods: `Convert.ToInt32()`, `Convert.ToSingle()` (for float), `Convert.ToDouble()`, `Convert.ToString()`.
    - Example converting a string input to an integer:

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:");
    string userInput = Console.ReadLine();
    int number = Convert.ToInt32(userInput); // Convert string to int
    Console.WriteLine("You entered: " + number);
    ```

- When performing operations with mixed data types, C# follows rules of type promotion. If any operand in a `+` operation is a `string`, all other operands are converted to `string`s, and the operation becomes string concatenation.
- To perform arithmetic operations correctly when dealing with string input that needs to be treated as a number, you must **convert the string to a numeric type *before* the operation**.
- Use **parentheses `()`** to ensure that conversions and arithmetic operations happen in the desired order due to operator precedence.
- Example: Converting input string to int and adding 4.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("How many candies do you want?");
string candyInput = Console.ReadLine();
// Incorrect: string concatenation
// Console.WriteLine("You will get " + candyInput + 4 + " more candies"); // Might output "44" if input is "4"

// Correct: Convert to int and then add
int candyCount = Convert.ToInt32(candyInput);
Console.WriteLine("You will get " + (candyCount + 4) + " more candies"); // Output will be "You will get 8 more candies" if input is "4"
```

### Operators

- Operators perform operations on variables and values.
- Types of operators in C#:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform mathematical operations.
    - `+` (Addition)
    - `-` (Subtraction)
    - `*` (Multiplication)
    - `/` (Division)

2. **Assignment Operators**: Assign values to variables.
    - `=` (Assign)
    - `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` (Combine arithmetic and assignment)

3. **Logical Operators**: Combine boolean values or expressions.
    - `&&` (Logical AND): Returns `true` if both operands are `true`.
    - `||` (Logical OR): Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.
    - `!` (Logical NOT): Reverses the boolean state ( `!true` is `false`, `!false` is `true`).

4. **Comparison Operators**: Compare two values and return a boolean result (`true` or `false`).
    - `>` (Greater than)
    - `<` (Less than)
    - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
    - `<=` (Less than or equal to)
    - `==` (Equal to)
    - `!=` (Not equal to)

### Math Class

- The `System.Math` class provides static methods for mathematical operations.
- It includes functions like finding the maximum or minimum of two numbers, rounding, etc..
- Example:

```csharp
int maxNumber = Math.Max(34, 39); // Finds the maximum value
Console.WriteLine(maxNumber); // Output: 39
```

- You can find documentation for all `Math` class functions on Microsoft's website or by searching online.

### String Methods and Properties

- Strings have built-in members (properties and methods) for manipulating text.
- **`.Length`**: A property that returns the number of characters in the string.
- Example:

```csharp
string greeting = "Hello World";
Console.WriteLine(greeting.Length); // Output: 11
```

- **`.ToUpper()`**: A method that returns a new string with all characters converted to uppercase.
- **`.ToLower()`**: A method that returns a new string with all characters converted to lowercase.
- Example:

```csharp
string message = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(message.ToUpper()); // Output: HELLO
Console.WriteLine(message.ToLower()); // Output: hello
```

- **String Concatenation**: Joining strings using the `+` operator.
- Example:

```csharp
string part1 = "Hello";
string part2 = "World";
string fullMessage = part1 + " " + part2;
Console.WriteLine(fullMessage); // Output: Hello World
```

- **String Interpolation**: A more readable way to embed variables inside strings using the `$` prefix and curly braces `{}`.
- Example:

```csharp
string name = "Harry";
Console.WriteLine($"Hello {name}, you are learning C#.");
```

- **Accessing Characters**: Individual characters in a string can be accessed using square brackets `[]` and their index.
- **String indexing starts at 0** in C#. The first character is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
- Example:

```csharp
string word = "C#";
Console.WriteLine(word); // Output: C
Console.WriteLine(word); // Output: #
```

- **`.IndexOf()`**: A method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified substring within the string.
- Example:

```csharp
string sentence = "This is a test";
Console.WriteLine(sentence.IndexOf("is")); // Output: 2 (index of the first 'i' in "is")
```

- **`.Substring()`**: A method that returns a new string starting from a specified index. You can also specify the length of the substring.
- Example:

```csharp
string data = "abcdefgh";
Console.WriteLine(data.Substring(3)); // Output: defgh (starts from index 3 to the end)
Console.WriteLine(data.Substring(3, 2)); // Output: de (starts from index 3, takes 2 characters)
```

- **Escape Sequences**: Special character combinations used within strings to represent characters that are difficult to type or have special meaning. They start with a backslash `\`.
  - `\"`: Double quote
  - `\'`: Single quote (more relevant for characters)
  - `\\`: Backslash
  - `\n`: Newline
  - `\t`: Tab
- Example:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("He said, \"Hello!\""); // Output: He said, "Hello!"
Console.WriteLine("Line 1\nLine 2"); // Output: Line 1 followed by Line 2 on a new line
```

- **Important**: Most string methods return a *new* string; they do not modify the original string.

### Decision Control (If-Else and Switch)

- Decision control statements allow your program to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

1.**If-Else If-Else**:
    - The `if` statement executes a block of code if a condition is `true`.
    - An optional `else if` statement can be used to check another condition if the previous `if` or `else if` conditions were `false`. You can have multiple `else if` blocks.
    - An optional `else` statement executes a block of code if all preceding `if` and `else if` conditions were `false`.
    - **Only one** of the `if`, `else if`, or `else` blocks will execute.

- Example:

```csharp
int age = 16;

if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You can drive.");
}
else if (age >= 16) // This condition is checked only if age is NOT >= 18
{
    Console.WriteLine("Almost there, please wait.");
}
else // This block executes if age is NOT >= 18 AND NOT >= 16
{
    Console.WriteLine("You cannot drive yet.");
}
```

2.**Switch Case**:
    - An alternative to multiple `else if` statements, used to execute different code blocks based on the **value of a single variable**.
    - The variable's value is compared against multiple `case` labels.
    - If a match is found, the code in that `case` block is executed.
    - A `break` statement is required after each `case` block to exit the `switch` statement.
    - The optional `default` case executes if none of the `case` labels match the variable's value.

- Example:

```csharp
int day = 3;

switch (day)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Another day");
        break;
}
```

### Loops

- Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
- Using loops is a **better alternative for repetitive statements** than writing the same code manually multiple times.

1.**While Loop**:
    - Executes a block of code **as long as a condition is `true`**.
    - The condition is checked *before* each iteration. If the condition is initially `false`, the loop body will not execute at all.

- Example:

```csharp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++; // Increment i to eventually make the condition false
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

2.**Do-While Loop**:
    - Executes a block of code **at least once**, and then continues to execute as long as a condition is `true`.
    - The condition is checked *after* the first iteration.

- Example:

```csharp
int i = 0;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++; // Increment i
} while (i < 5); // Condition checked after the first run
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (Same output as while in this case, but runs at least once)

// If condition is initially false:
int j = 5;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(j); // Executes once
    j++;
} while (j < 5); // Condition is false, loop exits after the first iteration
// Output: 5
```

3.**For Loop**:
    - Provides a more structured way to loop, especially when you know the number of iterations or need an index.
    - It has three parts separated by semicolons:
        - **Initialization**: Executed once at the beginning of the loop (e.g., `int i = 0;`).
        - **Condition**: Checked *before* each iteration. If `true`, the loop continues; if `false`, the loop exits (e.g., `i < 5;`).
        - **Update Statement**: Executed *after* each iteration (e.g., `i++`).

- Example:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### Loop Control Statements

- **`break`**:
  - Used inside a loop (or `switch`) to **exit the loop immediately and permanently**.
  - The program continues execution at the first statement *after* the loop.
- Example:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i); // This will print only once
    break; // Exits the loop immediately
}
// Output: 0
```

- **`continue`**:
  - Used inside a loop to **skip the rest of the current iteration** and proceed to the next iteration.
  - The loop's update statement (in a `for` loop) or condition check (in `while`/`do-while`) is performed after `continue`.
- Example:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    if (i == 2)
    {
        continue; // Skip the rest of the code for this iteration when i is 2
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 3, 4 (2 is skipped)
```

### Methods (Functions)

- **Methods (or functions)** are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be reused.
- They help to avoid repeating code (DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself).
- The `Main` method is an example of a method.
- **Structure of a Method**:
  - `Access Modifier` (e.g., `public`, `private`, `static`)
  - `Return Type` (e.g., `void`, `int`, `string`, `float`)
  - `Method Name` (e.g., `Greet`, `Average`)
  - `Parameters` (inputs to the method, defined in parentheses `()`)
  - `Method Body` (code executed when the method is called, in curly braces `{}`)

- **`static` Keyword**:
  - Indicates that the method belongs to the class itself rather than a specific instance (object) of the class.
  - You can call a static method directly using the class name (e.g., `Program.Main()`, `Console.WriteLine()`).

- **`void` Keyword**:
  - Means the method **does not return any value** after it finishes execution.

- **Return Type**:
  - If a method is not `void`, it must specify the type of value it will return.
  - The `return` keyword is used to send a value back from the method.
  - Example:

    ```csharp
    static int AddNumbers(int num1, int num2) // Returns an int
    {
        int sum = num1 + num2;
        return sum; // Returns the calculated sum
    }

    // Calling the method and storing the returned value
    int result = AddNumbers(5, 3); // result will be 8
    ```

- **Method Overloading**:
  - Defining multiple methods in the same class with the **same name but different parameter lists** (different number or types of parameters).
  - The compiler determines which method to call based on the arguments provided.
- Example:

```csharp
static double Average(double a, double b) // Average of two doubles
{
    return (a + b) / 2;
}

static double Average(double a, double b, double c) // Average of three doubles
{
    return (a + b + c) / 3;
}

// The compiler knows which Average method to call based on the number of arguments
double avg1 = Average(10.0, 20.0);
double avg2 = Average(10.0, 20.0, 30.0);
```

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and Objects

- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code.
- The key concepts are **Classes and Objects**.
- **Class**:
  - A **blueprint or template** for creating objects.
  - It defines the properties (data members) and methods (member functions) that objects of that class will have.
  - Think of a class like a custom data type you create. For example, just like `int` is a type, you can create a `Player` class as a type.
  - Classes help model real-world entities. For example, a `Player` class in a game might have properties like `Name`, `Health`, `Position` and methods like `Run()`, `Shoot()`.

- **Object**:
  - An **instance** of a class.
  - When you create an object from a class, you are creating a specific instance of that blueprint.
  - Example: Creating a `Player` object named `tommy` from the `Player` class.
  - Objects have their own unique set of property values (e.g., `tommy` might have `Name = "Tommy"` and `Health = 100`).

- To create a new class in Visual Studio, right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, go to "Add", then "New Item", select "Class", give it a name (e.g., "Player.cs"), and click "Add".

- Example Class Definition (`Player.cs`):

```csharp
using System;

public class Player
{
    // Properties (Data Members)
    public string Name;
    private int Health; // Marked as private

    // Methods (Member Functions)
    public void SetHealth(int newHealth)
    {
        Health = newHealth;
    }

    public int GetHealth() // Method to access the private Health property
    {
        return Health;
    }
}
```

- **Access Modifiers**:
  - Keywords that control the accessibility of classes and their members (properties, methods).
  - **`public`**: The member is accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
  - **`private`**: The member is accessible **only within the same class**.
  - **`protected`**: The member is accessible within the same class and by derived classes (classes that inherit from this class).

- **Creating an Object**:
  - Use the `new` keyword followed by the class name.
  - Example (in `Main` method):

    ```csharp
    // Creating an object (instance) of the Player class
    Player tommy = new Player();
    ```

- **Accessing Members**:
  - Use the object name followed by the dot operator (`.`) to access its public properties and methods.
  - Example:

    ```csharp
    tommy.Name = "Tommy Vercetti"; // Accessing and setting a public property
    tommy.SetHealth(100); // Calling a public method

    // Cannot access private members directly:
    // Console.WriteLine(tommy.Health); // Error! Health is private

    // Access private member using a public method:
    Console.WriteLine(tommy.GetHealth()); // Output: 100
    ```

- **OOP Benefits**: Makes complex programs easier to manage by organizing code into objects that model real-world concepts. Promotes code reusability.
- **Caution**: Don't overuse classes for simple tasks. Use classes when they help structure and manage complexity. Follow the DRY principle (Do Not Repeat Yourself).

- **Inheritance**: (Briefly mentioned as a concept for a future course). Inheritance allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (base class).

## MS_Learn: Create and run simple C# console applications (Get started with C#, Part 2) 

## What is the .NET Class Library?

The .NET Class Library is a collection of thousands of classes containing tens of thousands of methods. For example, the .NET Class Library includes the `Console` class for developers working on console applications. The `Console` class includes methods for input and output operations such as `Write()`, `WriteLine()`, `Read()`, `ReadLine()`, and many others.

### Even data types are part of the .NET Class Library

C# data types (such as `string` and `int`) are actually made available through classes in the .NET Class Library. The C# language masks the connection between the data types and the .NET classes in order to simplify your work.

## Stateful versus stateless methods

In software development projects, the term **state** is used to describe the condition of the execution environment at a specific moment in time. As your code executes line by line, values are stored in variables. At any moment during execution, the current state of the application is the collection of all values stored in memory.

Some methods don't rely on the current state of the application to work properly. In other words, **stateless methods** are implemented so that they can work without referencing or changing any values already stored in memory. Stateless methods are also known as **static methods**.

```c#
Random dice = new Random();
int roll = dice.Next(1, 7);
Console.WriteLine(roll);
```

On the third code line, you include a reference to the `Console` class and call the `Console.WriteLine()` method directly. However, you use a different technique for calling the `Random.Next()` method. The reason why you're using two different techniques is because some methods are "stateful" and others are "stateless". You examine the difference between stateful and stateless methods in the next section.

The `Console.WriteLine()` method doesn't rely on any values stored in memory. It performs its function and finishes without impacting the state of the application in any way.

Other methods, however, must have access to the state of the application to work properly. In other words, **stateful methods** are built in such a way that they rely on values stored in memory by previous lines of code that have already been executed. Or they modify the state of the application by updating values or storing new values in memory. They're also known as **instance methods**.

Stateful (instance) methods keep track of their state in _fields_, which are variables defined on the class. Each new instance of the class gets its own copy of those fields in which to store state.

A single class can support both stateful and stateless methods. However, when you need to call stateful methods, you must first create an _instance_ of the class so that the method can access state.

## Creating an instance of a class

An instance of a class is called an _object_. To create a new instance of a class, you use the `new` operator. Consider the following line of code that creates a new instance of the `Random` class to create a new object called `dice`:

```
Random dice = new Random();
```

The `new` operator does several important things:

-   It first requests an address in the computer's memory large enough to store a new object based on the `Random` class.
-   It creates the new object, and stores it at the memory address.
-   It returns the memory address so that it can be saved in the `dice` object.

From that point on, when the `dice` object is referenced in code, the .NET Runtime performs a lookup behind the scenes to give the illusion that you're working directly with the object itself.

Your code uses the `dice` object like a variable that stores the state of the `Random` class. When you call the `Next()` method on the `dice` object, the method uses the state stored in the `dice` object to generate a random number.

The latest version of the .NET Runtime enables you to instantiate an object without having to repeat the type name (target-typed constructor invocation). For example, the following code will create a new instance of the `Random` class:

```
Random dice = new();
```

The intention is to simplify code readability. You always use parentheses when writing a target-typed `new` expression.

## Why is the Next() method stateful?

You might be wondering why the `Next()` method was implemented as a stateful method? Couldn't the .NET Class Library designers figure out a way to generate a random number without requiring state? And what exactly is being stored or referenced by the `Next()` method?

These are fair questions. At a high level, computers are good at following specific instructions to create a reliable and repeatable outcome. To create the illusion of randomness, the developers of the `Next()` method decided to capture the date and time down to the fraction of a millisecond and use that to seed an algorithm that produces a different number each time. While not entirely random, it suffices for most applications. The state that is captured and maintained through the lifetime of the `dice` object is the seed value. Each subsequent call to the `Next()` method is rerunning the algorithm, but ensures that the seed changes so that the same value isn't (necessarily) returned.

To use the `Random.Next()` method, however, you don't have to understand _how_ it works. The important thing to know is that some methods require you to create an instance of a class before you call them, while others do not.

## How can you determine whether you need to create an instance of a class before calling its methods?

One approach for determining whether a method is stateful or stateless is to consult the documentation. The documentation includes examples that show whether the method must be called from the object instance or directly from the class.

As an alternative to searching through product documentation, you can attempt to access the method directly from the class itself. If it works, you know that it's a stateless method. The worst that can happen is that you'll get a compilation error.

Try accessing the `Random.Next()` method directly and see what happens.

1.  Enter the following line of code into the Visual Studio Code Editor:
    
    ```
    int result = Random.Next();
    
    ```
    
    You already know that `Next()` is a stateful method, however this example demonstrates how the Visual Studio Code Editor reacts when you try to access a method incorrectly.
    
2.  Notice that a red squiggly line appears under `Random.Next`, indicating that you have a compilation error.
    
    If the method that you're interested in using is stateless, no red squiggly line will appear.
    
3.  Hover your mouse pointer over the red squiggly line.
    
    A popup window should appear with the following message:
    
    Output Copy
    
    ```
    (1,14): error CS0120: An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property 'Random.Next()'
    
    ```
    
    As you saw in the code at the beginning of the unit, you can fix this error by creating an instance of the `Random` class before accessing the `Next()` method. For example:
    
    ```
    Random dice = new Random();
    int roll = dice.Next();
    
    ```
    
    In this case, the `Next()` method is called without input parameters.
